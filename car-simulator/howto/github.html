<h3>Github workflow</h3>

<p>
The general workflow on github is to fork the project, which basically makes a copy of the project on your own github account, then apply the changes you want to make. Once you have done that you can create a pull request, in order to merge your changes back into the project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Forking a repository:</b> Go to the <a href="http://github.com/christian-reintges/amos-ss17-proj4">project repository</a> and click on the fork button on the top right of the page. Afterwards the project should appear on your own github page (github.com/&lt;your_login&gt;).
</p>

<p>
<b>Applying changes:</b> You can now clone and edit your forked version of the project as usual. After you have finished your work, commit and push to your forked project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Creating pull requests:</b> After you finished your work, e.g. implementing a new feature, go to your forked github page. There you can click on the button labeled <i>New pull request</i> and select which branches to merge. You and every other contributor can review and discuss the changes before they are finally merged by a contributor.
